# The confounding effects of high genetic diversity on the determination and interpretation of differential gene expression analysis in the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus


# First, to get WGS data and align to ISE genome



# Next, to create an mpileup file of SNPs within CDS of genes



# To determine the SNP rate per CDS
# Want to have the total number of SNPs with AF >40% cf ref genome
# And the total length of the CDS.

# To get the total length of the CDS:
# Use the gff3 file.
# First extract the CDS lines only. 

grep -E 'CDS' test.rna.seq.gff3 > CDS.test.rna.seq.gff3
